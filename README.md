# Signals and Systems Project – DOA Estimation

## Overview
This repository contains the implementation and report for my *Signals and Systems* course project at Sharif University of Technology. The project focuses on **Direction of Arrival (DOA) estimation** in array signal processing, exploring both classical and advanced algorithms. MATLAB was used to implement and test these methods under various scenarios.

## Project Objectives
The aim of the project is to study and compare methods for estimating the angle of arrival of multiple signals received by an antenna array. The work highlights both theoretical foundations and practical simulation results, emphasizing accuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency.

## Methods Implemented
- **Least Squares (LS)** and **Total Least Squares (TLS)** approaches for parameter estimation.  
- **ESPRIT (Estimation of Signal Parameters via Rotational Invariance Techniques)** for efficient DOA estimation.  
- Comparison with **MUSIC** and other classical spectral-based algorithms.  
- Simulation of coherent and incoherent sources, wideband signals, and different array geometries.
